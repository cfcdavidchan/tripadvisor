      "review content:  This was my first vacation rental and absolutely everything about this vacation rental was perfect. It began with the ease of booking and payment through Trip Adviser. Ryan e-mailed me immediately and from booking through my actual stay, he responded with answers for any questions that I had. He was a delight to deal with. Upon arrival we were met by a representative from Peahi Greeters who presented us with a welcome gift, showed us how everything worked in the villa and gave us some suggestions for places to dine. The villa was everything we could have wished for – clean, spacious, gorgeous view of the property and beach and exquisite sunset views. Ryan has stocked his villa with everything you could possibly need – toaster, blender, rice cooker, coffeemaker, pots and pans, dishes and silverware, basic condiments, beach towels, beach chairs, cooler, etc. The property is beautiful with the koi ponds, lap pool, freeform pools, hot tubs, barbeque grills and beach bar. Everyone at the property from the front desk clerks to the maintenance people were helpful and friendly. Our flight departed late in the evening and since Ryan didn’t have another guest arriving on our departure date, Ryan let us have a later checkout so we could enjoy our stay a little longer and didn’t have to find things to do before our flight. My security deposit was refunded promptly. I would not hesitate to contact Ryan for a future rental. On a scale of 1-10 my rating for Ryan and this vacation rental is a 10+.\n",

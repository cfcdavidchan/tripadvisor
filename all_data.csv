It\'s definitely a beautiful hotel with amazing views and the restaurant food is very good... But the construction site next to our villa slightly spoil the stay, both in terms of the views and tranquillity. To be honest we felt quite cheated as none informed us about the construction site at the time of booking and if we knew we probably would choose it. Also the bar/room service food is not up to the same standard as the restaurant\'s food.	3	July 2017	couple	{}	Paula M	57	unknown
